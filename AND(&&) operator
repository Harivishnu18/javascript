 The logical AND (&&) operator checks whether both operands are true. If both are true, the result is true. If any one or both operands are false, the result is false.



let age = 20;
let idProof = true;

// Logical AND checks both conditions
if (age >= 18 && idProof) {
  console.log("Allowed"); 
} else {
  console.log("Not Allowed");  
}
