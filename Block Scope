//Block scope.....................so block scope defines the varaiable and its print operation of console.log() should be with in the flower brackets
{
  let greeting = "Hello from inside block";
  console.log(greeting); 
}
console.log(greeting)  // for this we get undefined
// if we use var,it is not block-scoped,it behaves like it is outside the block
{
  var greeting = "Hello from inside block";
  console.log(greeting); 
}
console.log(greeting)
